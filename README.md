# Portugol Algorithms 🧠

Welcome to my logic repository! This project documents my journey into computer science fundamentals, focusing on algorithms and programming logic using **Portugol** (Portuguese Pseudocode).

## 🎯 Purpose
The main goal of this repository is to practice:
- Programming logic and structured thinking.
- Basic algorithms (sorting, searching, loops).
- Understanding flowcharts and pseudocode structure.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Language:** Portugol (Pseudocode)
- **Tools:** Portugol Studio / VisualG
- **OS:** Linux (Ubuntu)

## 📂 Structure
The code is organized by topics:
- `/basics` - Hello World, variables, and input/output.
- `/conditions` - If/Else and Switch case structures.
- `/loops` - For, While, and Do-While loops.
- `/arrays` - Vectors and Matrices.
